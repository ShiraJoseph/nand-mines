# NAND Mines
Minesweeper for the Hack machine implemented in Jack language. 

**Nand2Tetris** is an online, self-teachable course on Building a Modern Computer from First Principles http://www.nand2tetris.org/.

This was my project submission for the module 9, a game implemented in the Jack language, a minimalist high level, OO language we have implemented for the Hack machine, a 16-bit hardware wachine we had previously built starting from the very ground: logical NAND gates.
